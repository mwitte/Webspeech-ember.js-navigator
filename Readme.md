Webspeech ember.js navigator
============================

Webspeech ember.js navigator enables the user to navigate through a ember.js application with spoken words. Currently it's
tested on current Chrome only!


Build
-----
There is a Gruntfile.js for building the webapp with grunt so you need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Just run on CLI:

	npm install
	bower install
	grunt

This builds the app in the "dist" folder. Alternatively you could run "grunt server" instead to "grunt" to open the
live-builded app on opend node.js server.
